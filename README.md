# TODO Collector

One file for all your TODOs. That's it.

This plugin scans your vault for unchecked tasks and puts them in a single file. Each task links back to where it came from.

## Features

**Collect** - Automatically gathers `- [ ]` tasks from your notes into one TODO file.

**Organize by time** - Optional sections for Today, Tomorrow, Next 7 Days, and Backlog. Drag tasks between sections to prioritize.

**Drag and drop** - In reading mode, drag tasks to reorder or move between sections. Grip dots appear when you hover.

**Hotkeys** - Commands to move tasks between sections. Assign your own shortcuts in Settings > Hotkeys.

**Pin to top** - Keep your TODO file at the top of the sidebar regardless of sort order.

**Two-way sync** - Check off a task in the TODO file and it gets checked off in the source note too.
