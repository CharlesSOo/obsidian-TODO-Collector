# TODO Collector

One file for all your TODOs. That's it.

This plugin scans your vault for unchecked tasks and puts them in a single file. Each task links back to where it came from.

## Features

**Collect** - Automatically gathers `- [ ]` tasks from your notes into one TODO file.

**Organize by time** - Optional sections for Today, Tomorrow, Next 7 Days, and Backlog with task counts.

**Drag and drop** - Works in both Reading mode and Live Preview. Drag tasks to reorder or drop on section headers to move between sections.

**Hotkeys** - Commands to move tasks between sections. Assign shortcuts in Settings > Hotkeys.

**Pin to top** - Keep your TODO file at the top of the sidebar regardless of sort order.

**Two-way sync** - Check off a task in the TODO file and it gets checked off in the source note too.

**Decay timer** - Completed tasks show a countdown and auto-remove after a set number of days.

**Quick open** - Command to jump to your TODO file from anywhere.
